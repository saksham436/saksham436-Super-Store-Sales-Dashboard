This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of Super Store sales data across various dimensions like region, category, customer segment, and time, enabling smarter decision-making through visual storytelling.



**2-🎯 Objective:**

The main goal is to monitor sales performance, evaluate profit trends, and forecast short-term sales (next 15 days) to guide planning and inventory management.

**3-📍 Sales Forecast (15 Days):**

Two line charts show predicted sales using historical data patterns. The forecast helps identify upcoming sales trends and prepare in advance.

**7-📍 Region Filter Functionality:**

The dashboard enables quick filtering by region (Central, East, South, West), helping to narrow down performance comparisons geographically.
**8-🌍 Map Visualization:**

The map view links geographical data with sales and profit figures, helping locate strong and weak performing areas spatially.

**9-⚠️ Challenges & Limitations:**


Forecasting accuracy is dependent on historical trends.

Manual refresh dependency in some cases.
