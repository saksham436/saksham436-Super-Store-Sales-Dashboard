This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of Super Store sales data across various dimensions like region, category, customer segment, and time, enabling smarter decision-making through visual storytelling.

**🎯 Objective:**

The main goal is to monitor sales performance, evaluate profit trends, and forecast short-term sales (next 15 days) to guide planning and inventory management.

**📍 Sales Forecast (15 Days):**

Two line charts show predicted sales using historical data patterns. The forecast helps identify upcoming sales trends and prepare in advance.

**📌 State-wise Analysis:**

A bar chart compares total sales across U.S. states. California, New York, and Texas emerge as top contributors.

**🗂️ Segment & Payment Mode Insights:**

Donut charts show performance across customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) and payment methods (Cards, Online, COD).

**📅 Monthly Trends:**

Area charts highlight sales and profit trends by month (for 2019–2020), allowing seasonal pattern recognition and business cycle monitoring.

**📍 Region Filter Functionality:**

The dashboard enables quick filtering by region (Central, East, South, West), helping to narrow down performance comparisons geographically.
**🌍 Map Visualization:**

The map view links geographical data with sales and profit figures, helping locate strong and weak performing areas spatially.

**⚠️ Challenges & Limitations:**


Forecasting accuracy is dependent on historical trends.

Real-time data isn't integrated.

Limited drill-down capabilities for customer behavior or SKU-level analysis.

Manual refresh dependency in some cases.
